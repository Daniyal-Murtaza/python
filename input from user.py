# INPUT FUNCTION ALWAYS TAKE INPUT FROM THE USER AS THE STRING DATA TYPE  ALWAYS!!!!!

name = input("Enter your name:")
print("hello"+name) 

# since input function always uses string data type to take input therefore we don't need to change it!

age = input("enter your age:")
print("your age is"+age)

# here age will be in the strings like 18 or 19 is the string data type not the integer so be cautious of this fact!
