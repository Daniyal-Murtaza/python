# string formatting 3 types
# python 2
# python 3
# python 3.6


name = input("Enter your name:")
age = input("Enter your age:")
#print("My name is"+name+"and age is"+age)           # this is ugly syntax

#Therefore python 3 was introduced 

#print("My name is {} and age is {}".format(name,age))                 #These are called place holders {}
                                                                 # and the good thing about it is we don't need to change our data type

# now python 3.6

print(f"My name is {name} and age is {age}")

#BUT WE WILL PREFER PYTHON 3 FORMATTING TYPE BECAUZ PYTHON INTERPRETERS ARE NOT MUCH COMFORTABLE WITH 3.6 WAY NOW
