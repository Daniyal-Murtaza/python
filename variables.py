# rule one (variable cannot start with the number)
#i.e 13num

#first letter of variable should be alphabet or underscore

# we cannot use special characters in it like #$%

#user_one_name = "ali"   # the writing in the variable with underscore is called snake case writing
#userOneName = "ali"     # first letter is capital is called camel case writing

#python is a dynamic programming language because we can change the values of variables in it and python prefer snake case writing
