# loops
# while loop # for loop
# if we want to execute our coode again and again then we use loops or repetition!

# like i want to print hello world ten times then we can do it by normal method but then we need to write the code ten timmes therfore
# loops are used to resolve these kinda issues!

# While loop is similar in all the programming languages but for loop is different for different languages!
# let's learn with example!

i = 1                       # first we need to give the initial point for using while loop
while i <=10:               # jab tak yai condition true rahaigi tab tak ap kai pass while block execute krai ga!!!
    print(f"hello world {i}")   # here i in brackets will specify you the number of times the mxg have been printed!
    i= i+1
