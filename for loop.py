# FOR LOOP
# In previous loop type i.e. while loop we first wrote the program in which we have printed "Hello World" ten times.
# Now we are performing the same concept but applying For loop!

# i = 0                                          # when we used the while loop, we tend to give the initial point and increment
# while i <= 10:                                 # but the same function is done with using for loop is just "range(start,end,increment)""
#     print(f"hello world {i}")
#     i += 1

#Now using For loop:
# FOR LOOP IS USED WITH RANGE FUNCTION

for i in range (10):                       # we can also write this syntax as for i in range (1,11):
    print(f"hello world: {i}")
