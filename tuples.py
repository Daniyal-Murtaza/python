# tuple data structure
# tuple can also store any data type
# most important thing:  tuples are immutable, once tuple is created then u cannot modify
# data inside tuple

tuple_example = ("one","two","three")
# we cannot modify i.e. no pop, no append, no insert, no remove means we can't add or delete data

# tuples are faster than list
