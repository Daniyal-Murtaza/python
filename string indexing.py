language = "python"

# In python every word is built in recognized in an index i.e. in this example:
# syntax :  variable_name[index.no]
    
    #forward    #backward
# p = [0]          [-6]
# y = [1]          [-5]
# t = [2]          [-4]
# h = [3]          [-3]
# o = [4]          [-2]
# n = [5]          [-1]

# so if we need to print like h in the python then:
print(language[3])
print(language[2])

#but if we need to print the last alphabet then syntax is always
print(language[-1])
